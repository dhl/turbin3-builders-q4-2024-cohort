## blake2b-solidity

[blake2b-solidity](https://github.com/dhl/blake2b-solidity/) is a high-performance Solidity implementation of the
BLAKE2b hash function for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is currently the cheapest and fastest implementation of
BLAKE2b for the EVM, using only 14% more gas than the native Keccak-256 hash function. It is also the only
blake2b-solidity implementation that implements all the commonly used extensions of the BLAKE2b hash function, including
the ability to specify personalization hash, salting, and keying.

### L2X Protocol

[L2X](https://github.com/OAXFoundation/l2x-trustless-exchange/blob/master/docs/l2x-specification.pdf) is a high
performance, trustless exchange protocol that enables the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with the same
performance as centralized exchanges (CEXs). It is a very early app-specific, optimistic rollup design.
